## Restoration Instructions

To revert all changes and restore the original consultation form:

### Step 1: Restore ConsultationForm.jsx
Replace the modified `ConsultationForm.jsx` with the original version that:
- Has "Get Free Consultation" button text
- Contains original form submission logic
- Does not import the new popup components
- Does not have the additional state variables

### Step 2: Delete New Components
Remove these files:
- `src/components/common/CalendarPopup.jsx`
- `src/components/common/InvoicePopup.jsx`
- `src/components/common/PaymentGateway.jsx`

### Step 3: Clean Up
- Remove this documentation file: `TEMPORARY_BOOKING_CHANGES.md`
- Test the original consultation form functionality

## Original Button Text Reference
```javascript
// Original button text (to restore)
"Get Free Consultation"

// Current temporary text
"Book Now"
```

## Original Form Submission Logic
The original form submitted directly to `/api/submit-visa-form` endpoint and redirected to confirmation pages based on visa type and pathname.

## Notes
- All changes are contained within the consultation form and new components
- No database schema changes were made
- Original API endpoints remain unchanged
- Changes are purely frontend modifications

## Testing
Before reverting, ensure:
- Original consultation form works properly
- Form submissions reach the correct API endpoint
- Redirects to confirmation pages function correctly
- No broken imports or missing dependencies
